# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Weekly Challenge

Hello,

A quick explainer of my GitHub repo for the pandas-challenge. 

Within the file PyCitySchools, I have the Jupyter Notebook titled "PyCitySchools.ipynb" This is my weekly challenge assignment based off of the starter code Jupyter Notebook as an example.

Additionally, for my code within "PyCitySchools.ipynb" a few of the lines of code yielded warnings. In class we were instructed that warnings are fine, so long as they don't alter your output/change your output to something other than intended. My code seemed to work despite any of the warnings, so I left the code as is. 

Thank you!
